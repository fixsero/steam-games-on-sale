## Steam Sale Scraper
## Description
This is a Python script that retrieves information on games that are on sale or free on the Steam platform and prints it to the console. It also opens the Steam store page for each game in the default web browser.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.

and when you have innstalled it open sale_steam.py

The script will then retrieve the current Steam sale data and print the names, prices, discount percentages, and store links of the games on sale or free.

## Credits
This script was created by me as a personal project for learning Python and web scraping. It uses the requests library to retrieve JSON data from the Steam API and the webbrowser library to open the Steam store pages in the web browser.
