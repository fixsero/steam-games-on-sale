## Steam Sale Scraper
This is a Python script that retrieves information about games that are currently on sale or available for free on the Steam platform and prints it to the console. Additionally, it opens the Steam store page for each game in the default web browser.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.
3. Open the command prompt.
4. Type "pip install requests" in the command prompt.
5. Type "pip install webbrowser" in the command prompt.
6. Type "pip install json" in the command prompt.
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, open the "sale_steam.py" file. The script will then retrieve the current Steam sale data and print the names, prices, discount percentages, and store links of the games that are currently on sale or free.

## Credits
I created this script as a personal project to learn more about Python and web scraping. The script utilizes the requests library to retrieve JSON data from the Steam API, and the webbrowser library to open the Steam store pages in the web browser.
